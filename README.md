# React Exercises 1

This repository showcases my learning journey into React.js, where I practiced and experimented with core React concepts, tooling, and modern JavaScript.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- **React Basics**: Components, Props, State, and Lifecycle methods
- **JSX Syntax**: Writing readable and declarative UI code
- **ReactDOM API**: Updated to use `createRoot` in React 18
- **Webpack & Babel**: Integrated via `react-scripts` for module bundling and transpilation
- **Hot Module Reloading (HMR)**: To reflect changes instantly during development
- **ES6+ Features**: Modern JavaScript syntax like arrow functions, destructuring, and modules
- **Handling Events & Forms**: Managing user input and interaction
- **React Project Structure**: Organizing files and components for scalability

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the project
```
npm start
```

## 📝 Notes
- Updated to support React 18 with the new `createRoot` API.
- If using Node.js v17 or higher, set the `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` environment variable or downgrade to Node.js 16.
- This project is for **learning purposes**, not production.
